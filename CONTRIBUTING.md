# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute.
One rule up front:

**Human-authored pull requests targeting `main` must be raised through [`no-mistakes`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes).**
We require this to reduce the maintainer's burden of reviewing and merging contributions.

`no-mistakes` puts a local git proxy in front of your real remote.
Pushing through it runs an AI-driven review/test/lint pipeline in an isolated worktree, forwards the push upstream only after every check passes, and opens a clean PR automatically.

A GitHub Actions check (`Require no-mistakes`) runs on PRs targeting `main` and fails if the body is missing the deterministic signature that no-mistakes writes.
Dependency bots are exempt so their automation keeps working, but regular contributor PRs without the signature will not be reviewed or merged.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo, then clone the parent repo or set your local `origin` back to the parent (`git@github.com:kunchenguid/firstmate.git`).
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Initialize the gate with your fork as the push target: `no-mistakes init --fork-url git@github.com:<you>/firstmate.git` (fork routing requires **no-mistakes v1.30.1+**; without a fork, plain `no-mistakes init` still works for maintainers with push access).
4. Commit your changes.
5. Push through the gate instead of pushing to `origin`:

   ```sh
   git push no-mistakes
   ```

6. Run `no-mistakes` to attach to the pipeline, watch findings, and auto-fix or review as needed.
7. Once the pipeline passes, it pushes the branch to your fork and opens the PR against the parent repo for you.

## Repo conventions

- This repo is a template for running a firstmate orchestrator agent.
  `AGENTS.md` is the agent's entire job description; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, and `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills`.
- Only shared material is tracked: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, `docs/plans/`, `test/`, `tests/`, and `.agents/skills/`.
  Everything personal to one user's fleet (`data/`, `state/`, `config/`, `projects/`, `.no-mistakes/`) is gitignored; never commit it.
  The root `.tasks.toml` is tracked `tasks-axi` config for `data/backlog.md`; compatible `tasks-axi` uses it for routine backlog mutations.
  It does not make `data/` tracked.
- Helper scripts in `bin/` are plain bash.
  Each starts with a usage header comment; keep it accurate when you change behavior.
  `git grep -l '^#!/usr/bin/env bash' -- bin tests test | xargs shellcheck -x` must pass, and CI enforces it.
- Changes to harness adapters (launch templates in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, the adapter tables in `AGENTS.md`) must be verified empirically against the real harness, never written from documentation alone.
- Changes to visible backends must prove the actual backend contract.
  A completed app-server turn is not enough for `FM_BACKEND=codex-app`; visible Codex Desktop mode requires evidence from the app-owned thread path (`create_thread`/`fork_thread`, `read_thread`, `send_message_to_thread`, and archive state).
- In Markdown, put each full sentence on its own line.
